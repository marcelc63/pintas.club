  The Lean Canvas is a 1 page business plan template adopted from the Business
  Model Canvas.


  The Lean Canvas compliments the Business Model Canvas by providing an approach to business plan that is quicker and straight to the point.


  Ideally, it only takes less than 20 minutes to complete a Lean Canvas.


  Conversely, Business Model Canvas tends to be more elaborate and more lengthy.
