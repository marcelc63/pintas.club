This is a high overview of the framework before going into more details. For an overview, understand your market segment, product, channel, and model.

1. Market Segment - Who are you selling to? What’s their problem?
2. Product - What are you offering? What’s your solution?
3. Channel - Where are they gathering? How can you reach them?
4. Model - How are you charging them? Are they willing and able to pay?

The goal is to answer these four questions and have synergy between the four.
