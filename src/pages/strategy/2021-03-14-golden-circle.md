  The Golden Circle was first introduced by Simon Sinek from his book Start With
  Why. This framework explores the reason why people do what they do. Some
  purchase decisions and customer loyalty we’ve seen are hard to explain and
  can’t be put into words.


  The Golden Circle provide a framework that allow us to explore these questions for ourselves. In doing so, we may be able to discover our core vision, mission, and value proposition.

Ask the question Why, How, and lastly What, regarding what you do and why you do what you do.

1. Why - Explain your purpose and the reason you exist and behave as you do
2. 1. Success in communicating your ‘Why’ is the way to communicate to listener’s limbic brain, part of our brain that process feelings such as trust, loyalty and decision-making.
3. How - Strengths and value that differentiate yourself and help you deliver your ‘Why’
4. 1. Also communicate with the limbic brain and affect parts that governs behaviour and emotion.
5. What - Visible proof - Product or Service you sell
6. 1. The easiest for any company to articulate, engages the neocortex part of brain that’s rational. Neocortex is less of a driver for decision making.
