  The Value Proposition Canvas is a quick and structured way to note your
  customer’s needs, and compare them to the values your product is expected to
  create.


  Through the Value Proposition Canvas, you should have greater visibility on how well your product features map to your customer’s pain-points and nice-to-haves, providing you with an indication of how valuable your product will be to users.

1. Start on the right side of the canvas by noting all the jobs your customer’s need to satisfy / solve under “Customer Jobs”.
2. Given the noted jobs, derive pain-points they currently face and note them under “Pains”.
3. Similarly, derive nice-to-haves (experiences that make them happy) and note them under “Gains”.
4. When done, move to the left side of the canvas and note your planned products / services under “Products & Services”.
5. Next, consider how your products solve customer pains and note them under “Pain Relievers”.
6. Finally, consider how your products create customer gains and note them under “Gain Creators”.
