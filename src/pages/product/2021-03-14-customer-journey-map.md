  A Customer Journey Map is useful to gain a holistic idea of how customers
  interact with your product / service.


  In doing so, you may be able to generate ideas that enhance your customer’s overall experience. 


  Note that the Customer Journey Map considers “touchpoints” before, during, and after consumption of your product / service.


  Touchpoints or Moments of Truths are instances where your brand is in contact with your customer.
