  An Empathy Map is a framework you can use to summarize your findings from user
  research / interviews on a specific problem. 


  The map hones in on four aspects of a user, what they say, what they do, what they think, and what they feel. 


  Once summarized, you can quickly gain useful insights related to your problem.

1. After conducting user research / interviews around a specific problem, group notes together of instances where a user explicitly made a comment related to your problem - place them in the “Say” section of the Empathy Map.
2. Next, separate notes of a user’s actions related to your problem - place them in the “Do” section.
3. Then, separate notes of what users felt or thought related to your problem and place them in the “Feel” section and “Think” section respectively.
4. 1. Insights about how a user felt or thought can come from your assumptions or best guess derived from their words and actions;
   2. Alternatively, you can ask users directly how they felt or thought during customer interviews.
5. After organizing your notes on the Empathy Map, note down useful needs and insights based on what they said, did, felt, or thought.
