title: Benefit vs. Cost

description: >
  The Benefit vs. Cost framework allows you to objectively compare and
  prioritize initiatives based on their benefits to the business, and costs of
  implementation. 


  Once the benefits and costs of each initiative have been laid out, you can get a holistic view; which can be useful for quick comparison, taking into account all benefits and costs; or for detailed comparison based on select benefits and costs.

1. Note all the potential benefits to the business you care about.
2. Note all the potential costs of implementation you care about.
3. Assign a weight to each benefit and cost based on how important you think each is relative to one another (sum weights to 100%).
4. List all initiatives being considered.
5. Assign a score between 1 and 5 (let 1 be low benefit or low cost, and 5 be high benefit or high cost) for each benefit and cost, for all initiatives.
6. For each initiative, multiply their scores with the respective weights.
7. Sum the resulting benefit scores together, and sum the resulting cost scores together.
8. Then subtract the cost subtotal from the benefit subtotal to get the initiativeâ€™s total score.
9. Prioritize initiatives with higher total scores.
