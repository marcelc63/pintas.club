  The Eisenhower Matrix is a quick and convenient way to prioritize initiatives
  based on importance and urgency.


  The goal is to determine which initiatives are important / not important, and urgent / not urgent. We can then prioritize accordingly.


  The Eisenhower matrix suggests we should do tasks in quadrant 1 (important and urgent), decide on when to do tasks in quadrant 2 (important but not urgent), delegate tasks in quadrant 3 (not important but urgent), and ignore or mitigate tasks in quadrant 4 (not important and not urgent)
