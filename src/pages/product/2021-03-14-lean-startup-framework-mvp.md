Choose and try to execute one of the 4 types of MVP using the [Build-Measure-Learn](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_c7vef_9IJ-d8TAd02tf64crWyT7VpF4_nWRJi0eca8/edit?usp=sharing) methodology:

1. Concierge MVP
2. 1. Manually help your users accomplish their goals as means of validating whether or not they have a need of what youâ€™re offering.
   2. You can do this by opening a communication channel
   3. Make this MVP by creating a: Public Whatsapp Number, Instagram/Twitter DM, Discord Channel
3. Wizard of Oz MVP
4. 1. Promote the final form of your solution even though the means of running the product is manual work.
   2. 1. For example, offering an AI service but the answers are draft out manually by a person.
   3. This approach is to test out the desirability of the final form of the idea without having to fully build the actual product yet.
5. Landing Page MVP
6. 1. A single landing page that describes your product or service, unique value proposition, and contains a button that allows users to read more, join a mailing list, or some other action.
   2. This can help you gauge interests in the market before building out the actual product.
   3. Make landing page for free using: Carrd.co, Wordpress.com, Notion.so
7. Email MVP
8. 1. Test out your idea by sharing and engaging the potential of your idea with potential customers.
   2. Maintain a mailing list and write about the topic that eventually will become your product. Check the interests by looking at the open and click rate.
   3. Make email list for free using: Mailchimp.com, Convertkit.co, Mailjet.com
9. No Code MVP
10. 1. Build out your idea without code using existing tools available. This allows you to create a product now without the technical investment of coding.
    2. Create your MVP using: Google Sheets, Bubble.io, Coda.io, Notion.so, Webflow.com
