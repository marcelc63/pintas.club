title: Value vs. Complexity

description: >
  The Value vs. Complexity (or Effort) framework is a useful way to prioritize
  between initiatives. 


  The goal is to layout all initiatives, and prioritize those that are higher in value, and lower in complexity. 


  This framework can be modified by changing the axis to other relevant parameters depending on the task.

1. Make a list of all initiatives being considered.
2. Number the initiatives.
3. Draw two axes, one labeled Value, and the other Complexity.

(or use a different pair of parameters if more relevant)

4. For each initiative, assess and estimate how valuable the initiative is.Â 

(it may be useful to simply make a relative assessment i.e. compare how valuable the initiative is compared to how valuable the other initiatives are)

5. For each initiative, also assess and estimate how complex the initiative is.

(it may be useful to think about complexity in terms of effort required)

6. Plot each initiative on the axes according to their estimated value and complexity.
7. Prioritize initiatives with higher value and lower complexity.
