description: >
  The Value Proposition Customer Interview is an exercise that you can do with
  prospective customers to validate your value proposition.


  The idea of this exercise is to discover the value proposition that your customer need the most so that can be your area of focus. More importantly, it is also to discover the value proposition that your customer does not care about and that allows you to know what to avoid.


  The value of this exercise is two-folds. First, it encourages you to talk to prospective users and interact with them to understand their problem first-hand. Second, it provides a framework that allow you to quantify your finding for objective decision making.
