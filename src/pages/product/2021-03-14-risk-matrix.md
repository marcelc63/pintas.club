  There are many variations of Risk Matrices that can be created when
  considering the risks of a product. One we like, considers three major risks
  in particular: 


  Design Risk - is the product something people want?

  Market Risk - is there a market (that’s big enough, and willing and able to pay) for the product?

  Execution Risk - can your team execute the plan (building and shipping the product)?

1. Define the product, the target market, and the go-to-market strategy.
2. Start by asking “is this a product the target market wants?”
3. 1. Other frameworks in the need finding category may help answer this.
4. Then ask “is there a sustainable market for this product?”
5. 1. Consider market size, and the willingness and ability for the target market to pay
6.  Finally ask “can my team execute the go-to-market strategy?”
7. 1. Consider the team’s overall challenges and constraints
   2. Consider the complexity of product development
   3. Consider the complexity of operations and growth
8. Rate each risk as high, medium, or low.
9. 1. Consider the answers to the questions stated above
   2. Consider both internal and external uncertainties
10. Evaluate and iterate on any aspect deemed too risky.
