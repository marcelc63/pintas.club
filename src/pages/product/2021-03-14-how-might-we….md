title: How Might We…?
date: 2021-03-14T17:55:50.782Z
description: >
  The How Might We framework can be used as a stepping stone between problem
  statements and solutions. Once problem statements are defined, the team can
  focus on one statement at a time and brainstorm short questions beginning with
  “How might we”, that hint at a problem solution (without suggesting outright
  solutions). 


  The goal is to break down the problem statement into “smaller actionable pieces” that is used as the basis for more concrete problem solutions. By starting with “How might we”, teams are encouraged to not discard any ideas, and instead build upon even the wildest ideas to start, before selecting the most promising.

1. Define problem statements.
2. Select one problem statement to focus on.
3. Think of questions starting with “How might we” that hint at a solution to the problem.
4. 1. Include at least three of the following in each question to provide enough detail:
   2. 1. Who
      2. What
      3. When
      4. Where
      5. Why
   3. Questions should tackle smaller, actionable parts of the problem statement.
5. Post questions on a shared board so others can build on ideas.
6. Group ideas together and use them as a starting point to brainstorm concrete and viable solutions.
