  Design Thinking is a framework used to identify problems and develop practical
  solutions. There are five phases in design thinking: empathise, define,
  ideate, prototype, and test. Typically you would want to move from one phase
  to another sequentially, however, depending on your findings, you may need to
  take a step or two back.

1. Start by empathizing with your target audience.
2. 1. Select a target audience and try to better understand the problems they face within context.
   2. You can use frameworks related to user research here.
3. Then, define the problems you want to address.
4. 1. Take your understanding of the problems and craft meaningful, actionable problem statements.
   2. You can use the Value Proposition Canvas to support you here.
5. Next, ideate potential solutions.
6. 1. Focus on the problem statements defined and brainstorm ideas.
   2. You can use the How Might We framework to help with brainstorming solutions.
7. Make prototypes of the best solutions you came up with.
8. 1. Consider lo-fi / hi-fi prototypes or other prototyping frameworks to move fast and lean.
9. Test prototypes with potential users.
10. 1. Test your prototypes and iterate (if needed, start with step 1 again).
