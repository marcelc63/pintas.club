  Impact Mapping is a framework used to get a holistic view of initiatives
  (deliverables) so that decisions can be made on which to prioritize.


  By mapping out the goal, and listing related actors, impacts, and deliverables, you shift the focus back to “why” when explaining which initiatives to prioritize.

1. Start with the central goal you are trying to achieve.
2. Then expand to list all possible “actors” that can help you reach the goal.
3. For each actor, list all possible impacts (behaviors) they can have towards the goal.
4. For each impact, list all possible deliverables (initiatives) that make the impact possible.
5. Take a holistic view and pinpoint specific deliverables that are linked to desired impacts from desired actors.
