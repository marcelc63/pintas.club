There are four stages to the Hook Canvas which form a loop. When a user successfully complete the loop, habit is formed. As user continue to complete the loop, the habit becomes stronger until a point of “addiction”.

The stages are:

1. External Triggers: External events that lead user to the product. For example, a notification or promotion.
2. Action: The immediate minimum action that user can do to engage with the product after being led to the product. For example, posting a photo.
3. Variable Reward: A reward that user receive from doing said action. Reward has to be satisfying. For example, Social Proof such as receiving likes for the photo.
4. Investment: What contribution has the user made to the application that increase their bond with the product? For example, time and effort to create the photo and desire to maintain a great profile.
5. Internal Triggers: What sort of activity that will drive user to come back to the product? For example, desire to share experience with others.
