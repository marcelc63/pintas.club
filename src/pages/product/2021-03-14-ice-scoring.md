  The ICE Scoring framework is a relatively quick way to prioritize initiatives
  somewhat objectively.


  ICE is an acronym for three key parameters to consider when prioritizing initiatives:

  Impact

  Confidence (of the impact)

  Ease (of implementation)


  The goal is to get an “ICE Score” for each initiative, and prioritize initiatives with the higher ICE Scores

1. Make a list of all initiatives being considered.
2. Take one initiative and assign a value from 1 to 10 for its perceived:
3. 1. Impact (towards your end goal)
   2. Confidence (of the impact)
   3. Ease (of implementation)
4. Multiply the three values together to get the ICE Score for the initiative.
5. Repeat with all initiatives.
6. Prioritize initiatives with higher ICE Scores.
