There are three parts to Resource Based View: Resource, Capabilities, and Performance

1. List down the Resources you have
2. List down the Capabilities you have that will utilize your Resources
3. List down the Performance that will be a result of how you utilize your resources and capabilities

From laying down these information, see the connection between the three and see if there are mismatches and anything missing to your resources or capabilities that you will need to add.
