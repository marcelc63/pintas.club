The LIFT Model introduced 6 conversion factors:

1. Value Proposition - Why people buy from you
2. 1. Consider the cost vs benefit equation to gauge the prospect’s motivation
3. Clarity - Is your value proposition and call-to-action clearly articulated?
4. Relevance - Is your value proposition match what people are searching for?
5. Urgency - Is there any indication that the call-to-action must be taken now?
6. 1. Internal: how your customer is feeling (reminder, seasonality)
   2. External: influence your customer’s decision (offers, deadlines, tone)
7. Anxiety (inhibitor) - Are there potential misgivings your visitor might have about taking the action?
8. 1. Testimonial, Clients Logo, Security Badges help in removing anxiety
9. Distraction (inhibitor) - Are there elements that can divert visitor away from the goal?
