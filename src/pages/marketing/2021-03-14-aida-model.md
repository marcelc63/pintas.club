To use the AIDA Model, we identify the perception that an individual have on each of the following stages



Awareness: create understanding or affiliation with your product or service.

Interest: generating interest in the benefits of your product or service, and sufficient interest to encourage the buyer to start to research further.

Desire: for your product or service through an 'emotional connection', showing your brand personality. Move the consumer from 'liking' it to 'wanting it'.

Action: CTA - the desired action we want the individual to take. This can be to make a purchase, to sign up, to share something, and more.
