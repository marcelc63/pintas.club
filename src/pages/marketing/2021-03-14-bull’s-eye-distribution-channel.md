1. List all channels we can think of in the outer ring
2. Zoom in and choose a couple of channels that we think will most likely to work + cost effective to the middle ring
3. Draft a campaign for each middle ring channel
4. Test out campaigns
5. Identify winner distribution and double down
6. As we’ve outgrown our distribution channel, we can repeat the exercise to find a new distribution channel
