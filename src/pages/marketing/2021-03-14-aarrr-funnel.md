  AARRR is a funnel optimization framework devised by Dave McClure in 2007. It
  is designed to help marketers optimize acquisition in order to achieve better
  growth.


  A variation of AARRR is RARRA which prioritize Retention over Acquisition. Critics argue that RARRA is more relevant today since AARRR focus on Acquisition was more relevant in 2007 due to the emergence of new distribution channel that has yet to saturate such as social media.
