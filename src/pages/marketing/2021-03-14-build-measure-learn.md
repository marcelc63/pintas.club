Consider the diagram, there are 4 steps:

Plan

1. What is the idea you want to test?
2. What information do you need?
3. What hypothesis and assumptions do you have?

   1. Example: Increasing the frequency of newsletters from two to four per month will increase overall revenue
4. How are you going to test your hypothesis?Build
5. Build the smallest product (MVP) that allows you to test your hypothesis
6. Popular MVP for build step:

   1. Landing Page
   2. Slideshow
   3. Video
7. Try to focus on value and can be done quickly. Often without codes.
8. Launch to small group of users

Measure

1. Measure with method decided from Step 1
2. How does it compare with your hypothesis?
3. Does the data validates your hypothesis?
4. Do you need more data?

Learn

1. Make evidence-based decisions
2. Persevere:

   1. Your hypothesis was correct and you repeat the loop to get more data and refine your idea
3. Pivot:

   1. Your hypothesis was incorrect. Now you know what does not work and more importantly, what not to do.
4. Prioritize:

   1. Your hypothesis was correct and you acquire enough data. Now you can invest, double down on the effort and prioritize.
