  The Dead Zone is a framework that assess the viability of a channel along with
  the businesses’ model.


  Taken from Peter Thiel’s Zero to One, consider the excerpt:


  For a product priced around $1,000, there might be no good distribution channel to reach the small businesses that might buy it. Even if you have a clear value proposition, how do you get people to hear it?


  The product needs a personal sales effort, but at that price point, you simply don’t have the resources to send an actual person to talk to every prospective customer. This is why so many small and medium- sized businesses don’t use tools that bigger firms take for granted. It’s not that small business proprietors are unusually backward or that good tools don’t exist: distribution is the hidden bottleneck.

Have these questions answered:

1. Know your target segment, who are you selling towards?
2. Know your business model, how are you going to make money and how much?
3. Know how you are going to acquire users, through what channels?
4. Know how much you will spend to acquire users, what’s your CAC?

Then consider the Dead Zone diagram. If there’s a mismatch and you land on the deadzone, you will encounter a situation where the CAC will never justify the LTV. Hence, you may want to revisit your distribution channel or your business model.
