  The Perceptual Map is a positioning exercise, but focuses on how your
  customers view you in comparison with other competing products.


  Key difference: This framework map out your Substitutes and Direct Competition, instead of competitors in the industry.

1. Know who your substitute are. If your customer does not choose you, what else can they choose to fulfill the same need?
2. 1. Important: This exercise is more narrow as with Positioning, you often list down competitors in the industry that may not be your direct substitute.
   2. Bonus Exercise: Itâ€™ll be great if this information is based on results from surveys that you do with your customers.
3. Determine your X axis and Y axis. What two qualities customers look for in your product.
4. 1. The quality must be the opposite. For example: Cheap - Expensive, Non-Luxury - Luxry
5. Lay out an axis and plot all of your substitute. Then plot yourself in the axis as well.
