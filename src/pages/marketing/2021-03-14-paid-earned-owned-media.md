List down all promotion channels that you currently use and identify what media type it falls into.

With the classification and understanding of the media type, you can reconsider to reduce, add, and reshuffle the channels that you currently invest in.

Media Types are:

1. Owned Media - Channel you create and control
2. Earned Media - Channel that is a result of others’ contribution
3. Paid Media - Channel that leverage a third-party channel
