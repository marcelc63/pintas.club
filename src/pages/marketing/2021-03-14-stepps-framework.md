Jonah Berger identifies content or product that becomes viral is due to having 6 separate elements which he devised into the acronym STEPPS

1. Social Currency: People want to look smart. Does knowing this information make them look like an insiders and remarkable?
2. Triggers: Does the information is easily associated? Will it become a top-of-mind for people?
3. Emotion: Does the information moves people emotionally? Does it affect peopleâ€™s feelings?
4. Public: Is the information easily seen or discovered? Does it stand out and can be easily identified?
5. Practical Value: Is the information useful to others? Are there immediate benefit from the information that people can obtain?
6. Stories: Does the information has a narrative that can be easily understood? Is it a story people want to tell to others?
